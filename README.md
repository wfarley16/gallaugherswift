# Getting Started
    - Install Dependencies using Yarn
    - Reach out about .env files (omitted from repo)

# Commands
    - `yarn develop` => starts development server
    - `yarn lint:fix` => runs eslint on jsx files and makes changes
    - `yarn deploy` => deploys site via cloudfront to domain

# Arya, Your Assignment Should You Choose to Accept It!
    - On ProjectRoll.jsx, we want to add pagination
    - Fill in the function to set the start and stop (managed in state)
    - Add two Buttons (from semantic-ui) that both call that same function to update the range of cards you're showing
    - Add a label between the buttons that says showing X-Y of Z
    
    - Some extra practice for Semantic UI
        - Change the buttons for choosing a semester to a DropDown from Semantic UI
        - Change the posts to use Card from SemanticUI instead of article
